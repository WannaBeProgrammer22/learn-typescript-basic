create a file and the extension name will be .ts for typescript
main.ts
let message = 'Hello World';
console.log(message);

next step is to compile our .ts to .js using the typescript compiler using this command
tsc [filename]
tsc main.ts

and it will create a main.js file

main.js
var message = 'Hello World';
console.log(message);


to run the code use node
node main.js

error notes: cannot redeclare block-scope variable
because the file is treated as script rather than a module 
a module has its own scope as a script shared a global scope

to fix this need to add a export {} at the top of t he page
export { }

If you want your typescript automatically compile to javascript use the typescript watch command 
every time you save a typescript file it will automatically compile it to js
tsc main --watch
