Variable Types - essence of typescript
Boolean
Number
String


// we have a variable name isBeginner have a type of boolean and a value of true
let isBeginner: boolean = true;

// number
let total: number = 0;

// string
let firstName: string = 'Jerwin';

// multiple line with embedded expressions using template strings
let sentence: string = `My name is ${firstName}
I am a bignner in TypeScript`;

console.log(sentence);

what is the use of having types
2 important reason

1. static type checking - when u try to assigning a boolean value to a variable with the type of string it will give u an error/red squidly or the horizontal zigzag line - typescript will notify you with the help of static type checking
error: Type 'true' is not assignable to type 'string'

2. intellisense - it will show the list of properties and methods related with their types


// more types
